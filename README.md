# Nmap, Wireshark & Scapy Labs
Hands-on labs demonstrating Nmap scanning, Wireshark traffic analysis, and Scapy packet analysis.
The aim is to reinforce network scanning, packet analysis and documentation skills.

Objectives
The labs were completed to achieve the following goals:
Nmap
Perform host discovery, port scanning, service detection, OS fingerprinting, and scripting.
Understand different scan types and network responses.

Wireshark
Capture live traffic using tcpdump.

Scapy
Sniff packets and filter traffic.
Inspect protocol layers and packet structures.
